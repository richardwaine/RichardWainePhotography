When every headshot has different lighting, backgrounds and quality, it signals inconsistency. Clients notice. They wonder if the company pays the same attention to their work as they do to their image.

  Professional headshots that match in style and quality tell a different story. They show a team that operates under the same high standards and takes their work seriously. Clients trust organizations that look organized. They feel confident doing business with people who present themselves as capable professionals.

  Your team benefits too. Employees who receive a headshot they actually like feel valued. They represent your company with more confidence on LinkedIn, in email signatures and in every client interaction. The investment in their image becomes an investment in how they see themselves as part of your organization.

I provide clear and specific coaching that eliminates awkwardness and draws out authenticity. Small adjustments to posture, head angle, and expression make the difference between a stiff corporate photo and a high-quality headshot that projects confidence, competence, approachability, and trustworthiness. The goal is for every team member to see themselves at their best and leave with a skip in their step.

  Over 17 years photographing corporate teams, I have refined this coaching approach to help professionals who never thought they could look good in photos walk away surprised by how much they enjoyed the process.

        answer: `I arrange the date and terms with your point of contact in advance. On the day of the session, I arrive about an hour early to set up equipment, ensure everything is in good working order, and confirm I am ready to work with team members. Team members can be scheduled in increments that work for your company, whether that is every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or something else. Scheduling can be handled through my online scheduler, a shared spreadsheet, or internally by your team. I also accommodate a first come first served approach if that works better for your office.
        `

        question: "How much time do you spend photographing each team member?",                                               
        answer: `Some people are done in 5 minutes. Others need a bit more time and coaching. I schedule in 5 to 15 minute increments, but rushing does not produce high quality results. Every team member gets the time they need to walk away with an image they are proud of.
        `

        question: "What if a team member misses the headshot session?",                                               
        answer: `I am happy to arrange a return trip to photograph anyone who missed the original session. This requires coordination with your point of contact and carries an additional fee. If your team members are willing to travel to my studio in Lancaster, I can photograph them there as well. Either way, the images will match.
        `                                                    
      },
      {
        question: "How much space is needed for an office headshot session?",
        answer: `I require a space that is at least 15 feet by 15 feet with accessible power outlets. Wifi is helpful but not necessary. I am relatively self-contained. I bring all of my own equipment including camera, lights, backgrounds, computer, stands, tripods, and cables. I always clean my work area, and leave it in the same condition I found it.
