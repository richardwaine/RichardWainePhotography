## Who Needs a Solid Headshot?

I often hear chatter about who needs a good headshot, or who could use one. Usually, comments are more along the lines of "Oh, I don't need a headshot, I'm not an actor!"

Well, I've got news for you. 30 years ago, people only wanted a really nice picture of themselves, or they were in the arts or entertainment fields. Today, every single person NEEDS an amazing professional headshot. It is inconceivable to do business of any sort and not have a great picture of yourself.

Here's a list of people who need a solid headshot. If you are on this list, contact me ASAP!

- Actors
- Lawyers
- Doctors
- Real Estate Agents
- Authors
- Anyone who does public speaking
- Comedians
- Entrepreneurs
- Financiers
- Executives
- Anyone on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or any other social media platform
- Anyone with a website
- Anyone with an online dating profile
- Uber drivers
- Anyone with any sort of online identity

I know what you're thinking: "Rich, I know that I'm on the list, but I just don't see the need."

You may not see the need, but I guarantee your clients, patients, audience or potential love interest does! Let's face it, we are a visual society that makes decisions based on what we see. We need to show off our very best, and an iPhone image of you and the family dog just won't do.

Baltimore-based headshot specialist, Todd Dring says "In your career and in your personal life, first impressions matter, and now more than ever, that first impression is going to be made online. Whether you're a corporate professional, an academic, a consultant, or an actor, your online persona is going to be that point of introduction that will help cultivate your personal brand."

"But, Rich, I hate the way I look in pictures!"

Scheduling your appointment and choosing from the incredible selection of final images will be the most challenging tasks. Leave the rest to me! I will coach, guide and direct you into images that will knock your socks off, and may make you the talk of the town!

So, since you're on the list, and you have no real excuse for avoiding your personal branding headshot session, let's get you firing on all cylinders and get your image working FOR you.

When is YOUR session?
