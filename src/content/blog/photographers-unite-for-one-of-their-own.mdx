Nothing heals the heart quite like giving back to those in need.

A dear friend and fellow photographer, who has been wheelchair bound since the age of 8, was victim to an unfortunate set of circumstances.

Jaleel King is a professional photographer based in Philadelphia. He gets around via wheelchair and a minivan operated by hand controls. Due to a blowout on the highway, his sole means of transportation was totaled.

Most people don't see too many wheelchair bound photographers, so naturally Jaleel sees things a little differently, both physically and figuratively.

I asked Jaleel how he ended up in the photography industry. "I can't point to one thing that stirred the passion for photography that I now have. I just know it was something that I fell in love with, it was something that I felt like I can do without being judged because of my disability. If my work was good enough no one would care about my wheelchair but the reality of the situation is I can't have one without the other."

Photographers typically have a 'why'; Why they do what they do. Some are generic, but Jaleel's is a bit more profound.

"The struggles that I've gone through have shaped my worldview and how I see things through the lens. I love shooting people so I mostly enjoy doing portraits and especially love doing photojournalism or Street as others would also call it. I think in a way it helps me keep connected to the world around me when I feel like I just want to retreat into my own safe space. Photography is not always easy and neither is life. By photographing the life around me it helps to remind me how wonderful and beautiful and ugly humanity can be all at the same time but ultimately how surprising it can be in so many awesome ways."

Not only is Jaleel a fantastic photographer and educator, but also humble, gentle and a kind soul with a HUGE heart. For those that know him, he's fond of giving what he calls "BIG ASS HUGS." And, we love receiving them!

He is somewhat of a fixture at all of the major conferences and photography events, whether he is attending or teaching. For a man who pours himself into his clients and work, he excels at what he does. He isn't monetarily wealthy. Yet, he considers himself rich. "When it's all said in done I'm poor as hell but so rich in beautiful people who have embraced me and in some way I have touched for the better. That's something priceless!"

Jaleel has an incredible outlook on life, partly due to his limitations, but when asked about how photography and the photography community has changed or improved his life, he responded, "photography has opened so many doors that I could only dream of, taking me to places that I never thought would be possible! More importantly photography has connected me with people from all walks of life they have contributed in some form or fashion to my positive outlook even on those days that I feel like I just want to give up. The amazing people that I don't know if I would have connected to otherwise."

While the insurance company covered some of the cost of a new(ish) vehicle, you can only imagine the expense that goes into the required modifications for hand controls and other accessibility features.

Within a few hours of hearing about Jaleel's misfortune, the photography community banded together, and less than 24 hours later had made donations which far exceeded expectations.

Having been a professional photographer for many years, I have come to realize how special the photography community is. It's no secret that every piece of equipment is extraordinarily expensive. Businesses require constant cash flow and nurturing, and the majority of photographers are hard working people just trying to make ends meet. Yet, this incredible family of like-minded individuals donated whatever they could to help one of their own.

Naturally, as soon as I learned of Jaleel's incident, I donated, shared his story, and assisted in any way I could. Why?

I met Jaleel many years ago at a photography conference. He was fun to chat with, energetic, kind, went out of his way to introduce me to new people, and has made himself an integral part of my circle of friends.

Even if I had never met him, in the photography community, we take care of our own!

Despite how competitive the market can be, and regardless of all other normal business situations and circumstances, times like this remind us all that there is still decency and humanity left in this world.

I am proud of the photography community for stepping up to do what is right, what is necessary, and what kind, caring and loving people should do.

I am prouder still to call myself a member of this community and what it stands for. I am happy to call these wonderful people my friends, and be there for each of them if/when the need arises.

Jaleel looks at photography and the community as a wealth of compassion, empathy, and love, offering fresh eyes and perspective to the world around us. "We as photographers do so much that it's sometimes hard for us to actually see what we contribute and how we contribute to the world around us but we do. The influence that we have on the world through photography is profound and I for one I'm happy to be a part of a community that is just so wonderful, loving, and giving!"
