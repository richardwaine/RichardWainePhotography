_How one photographer's commitment to customer service and genuine connection sets him apart in the world of professional headshots._



{/* * * * */}

## Introduction

Las Vegas headshot photographer Mondo Rojas has built his career around the belief that a great professional headshot is more than a picture. It is a tool that communicates who you are and what you stand for. A specialist in headshot and portrait photography, Mondo brings a client first approach to every session, combining expert lighting, facial expression coaching, and genuine human connection to help his subjects look and feel their absolute best in front of the camera. 

In this interview, Mondo shares what led him to specialize exclusively in headshots after meeting his mentor Peter Hurley in 2019, how he helps even the most camera shy clients build confidence during a session, why professional visuals carry more weight than ever in today's digital first marketplace, and the one piece of advice he gives to both emerging photographers and clients who are on the fence about investing in professional imagery.

## About Mondo Rojas: Las Vegas Headshot and Portrait Photographer

### Can you briefly introduce yourself, where you are located, and the type of work you specialize in?

My name is Mondo Rojas I'm located in Las Vegas Nevada and I specialize in Headshot and Portrait Photography. 

### What led you into this creative field, and what keeps you passionate about it?

In the summer of 2019 I met and became friends with my Mentor, Peter Hurley.  Prior to that moment I, like most photographers, worked whatever gig I could (ie. weddings, family portraits, high school seniors etc.). After meeting Peter, I niched down my services to only headshots and portraits and haven't looked back. 

My clients keep me passionate about what I do. Being able to meet new people and connect with them, learn about who they are, their families and where they come from, has given me a very unique perspective on people as a whole, and how we are all insecure about how we look and how people perceive us in the world. 

As we work, my clients look at the images, and can't believe they could look this good.  When they begin to feel more confident in themselves, seeing and coaching that change is the real magic behind what I do.

## Mondo's Approach to Working With Photography Clients

### From your perspective, what makes a great headshot truly effective?

A great headshot is effective when that image captures not just the personality of the subject but also the reason they what they came to me. For example, if I the CEO of a multi billion dollar company makes a picture with a huge smile as a result of laughing, it isn't going to set the tone for who they are in their role. People look to them for leadership and guidance which means they have to look that part, so a bit of a squinch and a soft smile is what is going to say "I'm in charge". 

On the other side of the spectrum, if a small business owner who is looking to attract clients, I would aim for brighter smiles, and an overall happiness that says "come spend some time with me in my establishment". 

All of this works in conjunction with lighting, background, F-Stop, and the energy that is set by you the photographer. 

### As a photographer, how do you help clients feel more comfortable in front of the camera?

I believe that comfortability is set by familiarity. On the initial phone call I explain the entire process from walking in the door, me offering them refreshments, what the shooting process is like, then finally the image selection. 

No one likes surprises especially when there is money involved. I have found that if I lay out everything that is going to happen, it helps ease the anxiety and helps them feel more in control. It's the reason why we all have our favorite spots to eat or vacation, we know exactly what to expect in atmosphere, time, and cost. 

Once we meet in person, I treat them as though we are old friends, meaning I am genuine with them, I'm happy to see them, I listen to their concerns and just in general I'm inviting. 



### How does your approach to capturing people differ between photography and videography, or between genres?

My preparedness is what differs. I create shot lists that I know work and I do what feels right on the fly as well, along with what the end goal of the session is. For weddings it's about telling the story of not just the day but also the story of the couple being married, for portraits and branding I ask how you envision using the images and what demographic you are trying to attract. Based on those answers I'll create a shot list while always leaving room for experimentation.

## Professional Photography in Today's Market

### What's your opinion on the importance of professional visuals in today's digital-first world?

One of the reasons why I niched down to headshots and portraits is because I feel it is very important. Think about it, anytime we want to go somewhere new or need a vendor for a special occasion or in general like a wedding, birthday party, plumbing, etc. we go online and do research. As we scroll, what are we looking at? It's the pictures that said vendor is posting as a representation of them, their work, or facility. 

With that in mind, are you more or less apt to click on the link that has obvious stock photos, or cell phone images? Or, are you more likely to click through on a listing that shows professional photos of real people, the facilities and work product? 

You see, it's all about that implied value. If we portray our businesses or personal brand with a clean polished look it, adds legitimacy and increases that perceived value to prospective clients and employers. 

### Have you noticed any trends in how professionals want to be portrayed today?

Yes, as the baby-boomers and Gen-Xer's leave the work force, Millennials and Gen-Zer's are taking things over. And, their aesthetic is more business casual with a "chill vibe" because their target market is of the same age group who connects better with that look.  


### In your experience, how do different professions approach headshots differently?

It's their perceived value of the service. Lawyers and C-Suite clients understand how headshots are valuable and do have a ROI. Real estate agents and small businesses look at it as necessary but ultimately price is a factor and they don't see the value in spending the money on a high-end image.

## Client Preparation and Session Experience

### For clients who don't feel "photogenic," what advice do you typically give?

I tell them that the big secret is that nobody is naturally "Photogenic." 

Everyone we perceive to be "photogenic," from seeing their instagram posts, pictures of them on the red carpet, or a friend who never seems to take a bad photo, either learned what angles look best for them by practicing in the mirror, had someone else pose them to look flattering and now they mimic that on their own, or likely took multiple attempts to find that one picture that makes them look best. 

I tell them, lucky for you we are going to do all three today!  


### What kind of preparation and considerations do you recommend for someone getting ready for a professional shoot?

I tell them to: get a lot of rest the night before, use a deep cleansing facial scrub to clear out pores, trim nose and ear hair, don't go tanning right before the shoot, and bring clothes that make them feel the most confident. With makeup, I have them start light and natural and we can go darker and add makeup if need be. Small jewelry looks better than big pieces unless their normal aesthetic is big and bold then we will rock it!

### What's a common misconception people have about what a headshot session is really like?

For photographers, it is common to think that it's easy and something they offer just to tic a box off on their can do list for their site. 

For clients is that it's easy, you stand against a wall, show some teeth and click you're done.

## Professional Photography Process and Techniques

### What kind of lighting, composition, or direction tricks do you think most clients would be surprised to learn about?

Pushing their face out like a turtle to get rid of under chin baggage, and simple posing / posture is best. 

Having so many lights so close to their face always gets me looks and questions as to why. 

### What do you wish more clients understood about the process behind professional photography?

I wish more clients understood that depending on the shoot, planning and time is crucial in order to get the work they are looking for to help sell their personal brand or business. Being able to communicate their ideas effectively would go a long way to get a product they are looking for.  

Our clients come to us knowing they need professional work but haven’t done the research as to what resonates with their market. So they rely on us as the professional and want us to take over the decision making. That is as crazy as going to a restaurant and telling the server “I’m hungry and I hear you have amazing food so I need you to order food for people you don’t know and I need them to really like it”. 

Clients need to understand that we have to work together and communicate collaboratively in order to achieve the look that they are envisioning to sell their brand. If not, then they won’t be happy, the photographer feels like they have failed, and all the time and money is wasted.

## Industry Advice and Professional Insights

### How do you think photographers can differentiate themselves in such a competitive industry?

The biggest piece of advice would be CUSTOMER SERVICE. We as a society are starved for great customer service. Every aspect of your business should revolve around that concept. Be attentive to the client's needs, have answers to questions ready, and ask questions they didn't know to ask. 

Provide more in value than the amount of money you receive, and that will translate into better reviews, referrals and repeat clients. 

### If someone is rebranding themselves professionally, what role does a headshot play in that journey?

I feel it plays a big role because you must aim to attract the clientele or employers in the field they are rebranding to. 

For example you wouldn't use your corporate headshot for the website of your new gastro pub you recently opened and vice versa.
 

### What's one piece of advice you'd give someone nervous about investing in professional visuals?

Don't necessarily worry about the price tag. First look at the portfolios of the photographers you like. Look at the expressions and lighting. Is there a consistent look and feel to the work? 

Once that is narrowed down then look at the price. If you can't afford it call the photographer and see what can be done within your budget.

## Client Success Stories

### Do you have any stories of when a professional headshot made a real difference for a client?

Last year, I had an older gentleman come up to me while I was working a headshot booth at a conference. He explained to me that he had a facial defect from birth, and because of it he always avoided having pictures taken, and never liked the few pictures of himself that he did have. He said that he heard I could work magic and that's why he decided to have his headshot done. 

After using some lighting techniques and shaping shadows around his face in a way that didn't bring attention to that area of concern, I brought him around to the monitor. As he was looking at his image he began to well up with tears. He said that it was the best picture he had ever had of himself, and he grabbed me to give me a big hug and thanked me over and over again. 

I recently ran into him again at another conference. He told me that image I took of him is all over his marketing material and he loves giving it out to clients.

## Final Advice for Clients and Photographers

### Any final thoughts you'd like to share—whether it's advice for potential clients, tips for emerging creatives, or something you wish more people knew?

For emerging creatives, put the work in and push yourself to be better than you were yesterday. The biggest thing is: DON'T listen to your friends and family, who aren't photographers, about your business. They will never be your demographic, and all too often instead of building you up they, unfortunately, are the ones that make you doubt yourself and your business model. 

For potential clients, approach this as you would any long term investment. Research different photographers and find one that specializes in what it is you want, it's the difference between a handy man vs a specialized fabricator. Are the images "good enough" that will gain "meh" results or will these images make you money by drawing in business? 

After all that is the entire point of personal branding photography right?
