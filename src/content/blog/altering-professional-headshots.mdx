Recently, my brother came to visit Lancaster, Pennsylvania. For those unfamiliar, Lancaster is where I call home, and where [my headshot photography studio is located.](https://goo.gl/maps/FL1gCLfKEjJujUB66)

Since he took the train from New York City, and his return trip was canceled, he was a bit stuck. The next viable train would be from a central hub, like Philadelphia. So, I drove to Philly Philly!

On the way to Philadelphia and back, I saw some of my headshot photography work posted on billboards. Seeing your pictures on billboards is a very cool experience, normally. However, I didn't feel as elated as I normally do, or as I should.

As a professional headshot photographer, I am passionate about capturing the essence and authenticity of individuals and companies and I take immense pride in my work.

However, one issue that plagues the photography industry is the unnecessary alteration of images by other parties without the knowledge or consent of the photographer. This includes the graphic designers operating at the request of said companies or individuals.

In this blog post, I want to elaborate on why this practice is unacceptable, and even detrimental, and highlight why graphic designers, marketers, companies, and other parties should not alter images taken by a professional photographer without proper authorization.

To be clear, I am not referring to retouching as part of normal practice. I am also not talking about alterations that have, in fact, been authorized. This article is only in reference to the liberties taken on professional pictures by unauthorized parties.

1. **Misrepresentation of the Subject:**

   As a professional photographer, I carefully craft each headshot to reflect the unique personality, authenticity, and style of the individual. I do so using the workflow and aesthetic that I am known for, and for which I am hired. Altering the image in any way compromises the message, the authenticity, and the impact of the photograph.

   Headshots are often used for professional purposes, such as LinkedIn profiles, website biography pages, and marketing materials, among many others.

   Altering images without permission can misrepresent the subject, create an inaccurate depiction of the individual, and possibly damage the subject's personal brand or the company's reputation.

   I often remind my clients that I have a vested interest in their success. That is not just a platitude. I really do care about my clients. Because I do, I do my absolute best to ensure that their needs are met throughout the entire duration of our working relationship. A client should never feel the need to alter a picture on their own or use another service to do so. Especially since I, like most other professionals, take care of requested adjustments.

2. **Legal and Copyright Infringement:**

   As the creator of the original images, the photographer holds the legal copyright to their work. Altering their images without consent constitutes copyright infringement, which is a violation of intellectual property rights. It can result in legal repercussions, including financial penalties, and a whole bunch of additional aggravation.

   That sounds quite serious. And, it is meant to. However, it should be noted that these circumstances can easily be avoided by communicating clearly with your photographer. Photographers aren't unreasonable. Where things become contentious is when people and companies attempt to avoid paying the image creator for the rights to those images.

   Most (if not all) headshot sessions include rights to unlimited use of the images, so long as the images are used in a personal (non-commercial) application.

   Most photographers, especially headshot photographers, understand that the images will be displayed in a variety of places, and used on a wide array of platforms. We want to help you in every way we can. We just don't want to be taken advantage of.

   * This might not be the appropriate place to say this, but it needs to be said: Photographers are not as uneducated, inexperienced, or as "green" as folks tend to believe. We are business owners, and we feed our families using our talents. We will protect our businesses, assets, and livelihoods!

3. **Deterioration of Image Quality:**

   Professional photographers invest significant time and effort in post-processing to ensure that the final images meet our highest standards of quality.

   Altering images without the knowledge or consent of the photographer can result in poor image quality. It may lead to unintended changes in color balance, exposure, and other technical aspects, compromising the integrity of the image.

   In my example at the beginning of this article, I cited my own work on billboards. When I saw my images, I was shocked to notice that the people presented were significantly darker and redder than the original images I prepared for the client.

   I understand that folks like seeing their skin with a tan. Unfortunately, that creates a few issues:

   1. You don't normally look like that. Do you walk around with a tan in the winter? Probably not. This means you are presenting yourself inauthentically, and your clients recognize that.
   2. You are actually damaging your skin, and medical risks outweigh the need for a darker complexion.

4. **Diminished Professional Reputation:**

   Professional photographers build their reputations based on their unique style, technique, workflows, client experience, and their ability to capture stunning images.

   Altering those images without authorization can tarnish your photographer's professional reputation by associating their name with images that do not meet their standards or look like their work. It can also create confusion among clients and potential clients about the actual capabilities of the photographer.

   To be a bit clearer: What I am suggesting is that if you are a graphic designer, marketer, company, or another party who has sought to circumvent the photographer by altering pictures without authorization, you have made the decision that you are willing to disregard the reputation and work of a talented artist and businessperson because you either found it inconvenient or expensive. Neither are acceptable.

   If you are the vendor performing this kind of work, you might ask yourself if you have the legal right, and the authorization to perform that work. In other words, ask the photographer! If you don't know who the photographer is, I am certain that it would be relatively easy to find / figure out. You have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the work, and the rights of your fellow artists. Besides, do you want your legacy to be that of a person who is happy to change someone else's work without their consent?

   If you are the company or individual seeking out such a vendor, please understand that while we understand why you would do such a thing, it is in fact, reprehensible. This kind of underhanded play puts lives and livelihoods at risk. If you don't want to spend more than originally planned, then plan better! Budgeting is a fact of life. Whether you are operating your own home or your firm's marketing department. Learning to budget and communicate better will save everyone some of this hassle.

   Altering images without the consent of the photographer also raises ethical concerns. It goes against the principles of integrity, respect for intellectual property, and professional courtesy. It is important for graphic designers and other parties to uphold ethical standards and seek proper authorization from the photographer before making any changes to the images.

5. **Impact on Business Revenue:**

   Professional photographers rely on their pictures for income generation. Altering those photographs without proper authorization can impact a professional's ability to generate revenue from licensing or selling their work. It can also affect their ability to attract and retain clients, as those clients may question the authenticity and quality of the images if they have been altered without knowledge or consent.

6. **Potential Miscommunication:**

   I completely understand when companies and individuals have special requests for the post-processing of their images. This is quite normal and is even expected.

   However, once the images have been approved and released, there really shouldn't be a need to enlist the assistance of another vendor to further alter those images. If there is such a need, the client should be back in touch with the photographer first!

   It is incumbent on the client to clearly communicate the specifics and the needs of the project. Photographers will bend over backward to help. However, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the time, effort, and skill required to make changes require fair compensation.

7. **Loss of Artistic Integrity:**

   As a professional photographer, my images are a reflection of my artistic style and creative expression. I take enormous pride in the work I do for my clients. It makes me happy to make them happy! Altering my photographs without my knowledge or consent compromises the integrity of my work. This can be disheartening for any artist who takes pride in their craft.

8. **Unintended Consequences:**

   Altering images without proper authorization can result in unintended consequences.

   For example, changes made to the facial features, coloration, toning, contrast or expressions of the subject can create inaccurate representations, resulting in misinterpretation, misperception, or miscommunication. It can also impact the subject's self-image and confidence, as the altered image may not truly reflect their appearance.

9. **Loss of Professional Respect:**

   Altering images without proper authorization shows a lack of professional respect toward the original artist.

   It disregards their expertise, skill, and creative vision as professional photographers. It can also create a negative perception among fellow photographers and the broader photography community, impacting professional relationships and collaborations.

10. **Increase in Cost:**

    This is likely an unintended consequence, but it will happen.

    When individuals and companies take liberties with a photographer's work, beyond the scope of what was already agreed upon, it sets a terrible precedent. It also devalues the work of the photographer.

    When work is devalued, or isn't valued enough, one of two things will happen:

    1. Photographers will raise prices so that they still meet their revenue needs.
    2. They will simply choose to avoid working with clients who don't value what they offer.

    In essence, these types of activities make it significantly more expensive for clients to get what they want and need.

Altering professional photographers has the potential to misrepresent the subject, lead to legal and copyright infringement, deteriorate image quality, and diminish the photographer's professional reputation.

It is important to communicate clearly with the photographer and obtain proper authorization before making any changes

Photographers are artists and business owners who invest time, effort, and expertise in creating high-quality pictures that are reflective of the unique personalities and styles of their clients. They deserve to have their work respected and not altered without their consent.

Clients, graphic designers, marketers, and other parties should understand the value of professional photography and work collaboratively with photographers to achieve the desired results without compromising the integrity of the original images.

As a professional headshot photographer, I urge everyone to respect the rights and creative vision of photographers and to not engage in unauthorized alterations of their work. Let's work together to create authentic and impactful images that reflect the true essence of individuals and companies. Doing so can change lives for the better!
