Sometimes lack of clarity around expectations and workflow gives way to the question: What really goes into a professional headshot session?

If you’ve never experienced a headshot session before, you might think it’s as simple as showing up, smiling for the camera, and calling it a day. But in reality, there’s a lot more happening behind the scenes to ensure that the experience and results are enjoyable, help to further your goals, and are consistent with your brand and messaging.

Let’s take you through a typical day in my studio, where I turn headshot photography into a personalized, enjoyable experience.

* **Pre-Session Consultation:** Prior to your session, I always start with a consultation. This is where we get to know each other. Learning about your career goals, your personal style, and the message you want your headshot to convey is helpful in providing some direction, and aligning your preferences with my process. Whether you want something formal and authoritative or relaxed and approachable, we discuss wardrobe, backgrounds, and specific concerns to ensure everyone is on the same page.
* **Setting the Scene:** On the day of the session, I take great care in setting up the studio. Lighting is paramount in photography, and I use advanced lighting techniques to flatter your individual facial features. The chosen backgrounds are meant to complement your look without distracting from your face.
* **Positioning and Expression Coaching:** Most people aren’t professional models. I coach and direct you through a variety of body positions (poses) and expressions, helping you find the ones that feel most natural while exhibiting confidence and approachability. Authenticity is always more flattering than something contrived.
* **Multiple Takes, Multiple Angles:** I typically aim to provide my clients with “range” by rotating head positions, body positions, expressions, and clothing options. This gives us plenty of options to choose from during the image review process.
* **Reviewing and Selecting the Best Shots:** I use two large monitors to coach and direct clients so concepts are easier to digest. After we shoot, we sit down to review the images together so you can choose your favorites and discuss any minor retouching needed.
* **Post-Production Magic:** Once you’ve selected your favorite headshots, we fine-tune the image by balancing colors and dealing with blemishes or flyaway hairs. The result is a polished, professional image that looks like you—just the best version of you.
* **Delivering the Final Product:** Finally, I deliver your headshot images in multiple crops and variations. Custom sizing and requests are no problem, helping you achieve consistency across your brand.

Making professional headshots is a process that involves careful planning, attention to detail, and a lot of collaboration. Most importantly, it’s a process that’s designed to make you feel comfortable and confident, resulting in portraits that truly represent who you are.
