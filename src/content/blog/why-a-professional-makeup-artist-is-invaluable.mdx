It's no big secret that it takes teamwork to deliver consistent, high-quality results day in and day out. Whether I am working with my amazing retoucher or a makeup artist, each person is an integral part of my team.

Having a top-quality makeup artist I can count on is incredibly important. The application of makeup elevates the final images in presentation and quality. A professional makeup artist is invaluable. They consult on everything from skincare to proper color palettes that best flatter your style, skin, and bone structure.

In addition, the process of having makeup applied relaxes the client and evokes a level of confidence and a feeling of beauty that is beneficial when I begin capturing the range of expression found in a signature Richard Waine headshot session.

By bringing talented people into the fold, I can focus on that which matters most, the details and the process.

It is with great pleasure that I introduce Lionel Adriano, makeup artist extraordinaire.

Much like myself, Lionel is a transplant to Lancaster. Originally from Hawaii, he found his way out to Pennsylvania and I am glad to have been introduced to him.

Lionel and I had discussed collaborating for quite some time. We had some difficulty making our schedules work in the beginning. However, we cleared that obstacle, and have been delivering exceptional service and results for our clients.

Lionel is a certified M.A.C. makeup artist, and has been voted the best makeup artist in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania by the readers of Lancaster County Magazine, Susquehanna Style Magazine and Lancaster Newspaper on multiple occasions. His attention to detail, positive attitude, and perfectionism gel very well with my operation.

In fact, Amy, one of our recent clients had this to say:

> "Richard, and his makeup artist Lionel, were both AMAZING to work with! From the moment I arrived, they made me feel comfortable and walked me through everything. Having never done a shoot before, I needed a bit of coaching, but Richard was patient in his persistence about getting just the right shot. I highly recommend working with Richard for your photography needs!"


Lionel is a big part of the client experience in my studio. He has a calming, gentle demeanor and makes sitting in a makeup chair feel like you're at the spa.

I am glad to collaborate with Lionel, and look forward to watching him work his makeup magic.
