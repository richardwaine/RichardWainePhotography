faqs:
  - question: "HOW FREQUENTLY SHOULD I UPDATE MY HEADSHOT?"
    answer: "You should update your headshot every 1-3 years or whenever you find a significant change in your look. Industry reports suggest that professionals who update their headshots from time to time receive 40% more engagement on their profiles [18]."
  - question: "WHAT DO I WEAR FOR A PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOT?"
    answer: "Wear solid colors, avoid busy patterns, and wear something that makes you feel confident and professional. Blue, navy, and neutral-colored clothing photographs well and conveys messages of trustworthiness according to color psychology research [19]."
  - question: "HOW DO I PREPARE FOR A HEADSHOT SESSION?"
    answer: "In preparation for your headshot session, I have a few suggestions: Sleep well, stay hydrated, and discuss your expectations and preferences with your photographer. Ensure that you have shaved the night before (if applicable), that your skin is clean and moisturized, and that your clothing has been selected and is clean, pressed, and ready to be photographed. Some Professional photographers recommend that you avoid alcohol intake 24 hours before your shoot and get at least 7 hours of sleep to look your best [20]."
  - question: "HOW LONG IS A TYPICAL HEADSHOT SESSION?"
    answer:  | 
        While some may claim that headshot sessions take 30-60 minutes, with time for multiple changes of clothes and many different expressions, and that the actual time spent shooting is usually only 15-20 minutes [21], this is a very narrow view of what goes into a headshot session.

        It is entirely possible that your headshot session take less than 1 hour. It is also entirely possible to spend much more time. This is dependent on you, your needs, and the photographer's process. Personally, I don't put time limits on my sessions, and I take as much time as necessary to achieve the headshot images that work best for my clients. This could be 15 minutes. It could also be 3 hours.

  - question: "WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HEADSHOT AND A PORTRAIT?"
    answer:  | 
        A headshot typically focuses on your shoulders and face against a plain, simple background, while a portrait may include more of your body and environment. Headshots are professionally customized, while portraits can be applied to other uses [22].

        Technically, a portrait is a picture of a human. Every Headshot is a portrait, but not every portrait is a headshot. The eye contact and observation of a viable expression meant to resonate with the viewer makes a huge difference and helps to distinguish between a portrait and a headshot.

  - question: "DO I HAVE TO HIRE A MAKEUP ARTIST FOR MY HEADSHOT PHOTO SHOOT?"
    answer:  | 
        Expert make-up can define your features with camera light without appearing overdone. Research demonstrates that the respondents who applied professional make-up to their headshots had 62% more satisfaction with their outcome photographs [23].

        The big caveat is that makeup should not be applied to men who don't wear makeup regularly. Men who don't ordinarily wear makeup won't ever photograph well if they feel weird or uncomfortable. This isn't a question of creating the next news anchor. And, most of the makeup that news anchors wear is meant to reduce shine, glare, and flatten their skin in a controlled way. We don't have to worry about these things in headshot photographer, especially when your photographer has the skill to manipulate and control light well.

        <a href="/why-a-professional-makeup-artist-is-invaluable">A makeup artist can be invaluable</a>, especially when they have a gentle hand, an expert eye, and help to create a relaxed environment for you to have an incredible headshot session.

A professional headshot is perhaps the most valuable asset you can own for your career, business, or personal brand. Yet many put it off or refuse to have their headshots taken for a variety of reasons. Some worry about cost, while others don't like being in front of the camera. Busy schedules, procrastination, and even fear of judgment all contribute to the hesitation.

This article will delve deep into the most common reasons people avoid headshots, explaining each reason in detail. More importantly, I'll provide solutions and good counterarguments to show why getting a headshot is an investment worth making.

## Are Professional Headshots Worth the Cost?

One of the most common reasons why people avoid getting headshots is the cost. Most think that professional photos are too expensive, especially with all the other money matters. Some people consider it an unnecessary luxury rather than an investment.

However, the reality is that a proper headshot is one of the best investments that you can make for your career and personal reputation. In the age of social media where all first impressions get made online, a good headshot can literally open doors to opportunities. According to LinkedIn, profiles with decent profile photos are scrolled through 14 times more than those without photographs and are 36 times as likely to get messaged as those without them [1].

A study by PhotoFeeler found that using a professional photo on LinkedIn can make you appear 76% more capable, 9% more influential, and 25% more likable compared to taking a selfie [2]. These statistics indicate the tangible return on investment a professional headshot has.

There are also affordable choices. Some photographers offer several price points, mini-sessions, or group discounts. Rather than viewing a headshot as an expense, you should consider it an investment with a long-term return—connecting you, opening doors, and introducing you in the best light.

Let's assume that a professional headshot session costs approximately $500, and that the session includes a high-quality experience with a headshot specialist, including one professionally retouched digital image. Dividing $500 by 365 days in the year and your headshot costs you $1.37 per day. For $1.37 per day, you are investing in the creation of a revenue generating asset; one that will yield you more than $1.37 per day, if leveraged correctly. [The Return on Investment (ROI) of a professional headshot](/blog/return-on-investment) goes far beyond the initial investment. It's an investment in your career, your personal brand, and your future. It's a small step that can lead to significant returns, from increased credibility, authority, and engagement to new opportunities and long-lasting professional relationships. A great headshot isn't just a photo; it's a powerful tool for success.

## How to Overcome Self-Consciousness in Headshot Photography

The majority of people avoid headshots due to embarrassment over their appearance. Whether it's weight, aging, skin problems, or feeling uneasy with the way they look in photos, negative self-esteem can be an enormous stumbling block. As a result, many folks experience trepidation, anxiety, or even nervousness around having their photo taken.

This is understandable, but headshot photographers are trained to bring out the best in you. A good photographer knows how to leverage proper lighting techniques, angles, and poses that are most flattering for various face shapes and body types. They also create a relaxing atmosphere where clients feel comfortable and at ease.

A New York University study found that people always give more positive descriptions of professional pictures of themselves than selfies or casual photographs [3]. [Professional photographers use techniques which minimize perceived flaws](/blog/perceived-flaws-and-self-acceptance) and bring your natural strengths into focus.

Also, a headshot session is a confidence builder. Seeing yourself in a well-lit, professionally photographed image can shift your attitude and enable you to see the good things you have to offer. A good photographer will guide you through the process so that you feel and look your best, which also builds self-acceptance and perceived level of expertise.

Years ago, a client visited my studio because she needed a professional headshot photo for work. She was incredibly educated and accomplished, yet she had difficulty overcoming insecurities surrounding the aging process. While these negative thoughts did affect her at the beginning of the session, the process was significantly easier and more enjoyable than she originally thought it would be.

The results left her somewhat speechless. I understood her perspective. I listened attentively, letting her express her emotions. When she was done, I set very clear expectations for the session, and we took everything one step at a time.

I established a simple, straightforward process for the two of us to collaborate on her headshots. It took all of about 15 minutes before we turned out the first of many incredible headshots. When she approached my desktop computer, the look on her face said it all! Tears of joy streamed down her face. She turned to me and gave me a huge hug, and simply couldn't believe that was HER headshot.

I often tell others that I can teach a monkey to press the shutter button on a camera. The skill comes from being able to collaborate with, direct, and coach another human being into incredible facial expressions and body positions that best represent them.

Overcoming self-consciousness has more to do with seeing ourselves the way others do. This is significantly more difficult than it sounds. But, since we often compare ourselves to others, or feel that we must live up to unrealistic standards of beauty, or defy the aging process, we avoid self-acceptance like the plague. Sometimes the best thing to do is rest on the shoulders of an experienced professional. Trust in the fact that they know how to navigate these situations. The results often give clients the fuel they need to turn that frown upside down!

I am very well aware that this is not easy for everyone. It isn't easy to let your inhibitions go or to relinquish any degree of control. Take heart in the fact that your headshot photographer has a vested interest in your success. Believe me, we aren't in this field to make people look or feel worse. Personally, when I can positively change how you feel about yourself, turn out incredible pictures of you, and have you leave my studio with a skip in your step, I consider that a big win!

## When Do I Need a Professional Headshot?

Others wait to obtain a headshot because they do not feel the necessity of getting one. They may not be looking for a job, delivering speeches, or rebranding their social media, so they believe they do not require a professional headshot.

But waiting until you "need" a headshot is usually the impetus for rushed, last-minute decisions. Having a professional headshot in your pocket prepares you for unexpected opportunities. Whether a new job, a media interview, a conference speaking engagement, or a new company website, having a good headshot in your back pocket saves time and hassle.

Research by Career Builder shows that 31% of employers rejected possible employees simply because they couldn't find a professional online picture with a photograph [4]. And, professional workers who use a headshot are 68% more likely to be selected for events and panels for your industry [5].

I'm certain that you have noticed that speakers and panelists often begin their presentations with a professional headshot of themselves.

I usually tell my clients that the average useful life of your current headshot is approximately 1-2 years or when you change your style, your hair, or anything significant about your appearance. Remember, we change over time. We evolve. We get older, wiser, and more mature. Our styles and aesthetics change.

Imagine walking into a meeting with a colleague, business partner, or client who has never met you. All they know of your appearance is your headshot photo. If you are still using the same picture from 10 years ago, you are essentially lying to those people. Their expectations and reality are not in alignment. This creates trust issues in that they will wonder what else you are lying about. Obviously this is not a great position to be in. It's important to understand that having your headshot made is not only about you. It's also about the very people who view your pictures.

## How Much Time Does a Headshot Session Take?

Life is hectic, and setting up a photoshoot is one more thing on an already full to-do list. Family and work responsibilities, and social events fill up the calendar and push scheduling a headshot appointment to the side, so it gets postponed to "later."

A professional headshot photo shoot doesn't need to be a time-consuming experience. Some photographers have short sessions that last anywhere from 15-30 minutes. A few even offer on-site options, coming to your office or workspace to make it more convenient.

A survey of business professionals showed 87% reported their headshot session was shorter than expected, taking a mere average of 22 minutes [6]. For this level of time investment, the reward is considerable: 74% reported their professional headshot had directly generated a business opportunity within 12 months.

By taking a quick shot, you can have a headshot that will last years. The amount of time put into it is not worth much when considering the total benefit of having a robust, professionally created picture that amplifies your professional image.

I am of the belief that time limits, while helpful for structuring a day and scheduling other appointments and meetings, forces us to rush the results. Technically, my studio sessions have a 3 hour time limit, simply for scheduling blocks of time. In reality, I don't look at the clock and I don't really care how much time we take. I am focused on creating a high-quality experience and incredible images for my clients.

In truth, my sessions only go as long as my client requires. We can conclude the session in 15 minutes or in 3 hours. It doesn't make a difference to me as long as we achieve our desired outcome.

## Had a Bad Headshot Experience? Why You Should Try Again

Some folks have had unpleasant experiences with photography in the past. Whether it was an embarrassing school picture, an unforgiving family portrait, or a hurried session with a disinterested photographer, negative experiences can cause apprehension and even avoidance.

The key to overcoming this anxiety is choosing the right photographer. A headshot specialist is trained to get clients relaxed, guide them into natural positions, discover the best angles, and create high quality images regardless. A headshot photo shoot is even more about the subject than the average portrait sitting, with detailed care and attention that ensures tremendous results.

Satisfaction surveys show that 92% report satisfaction when dealing with professional headshot photographers as compared to mere 54% satisfaction with any other general-purpose photographers who also take headshots occasionally [7].

Reviews, portfolio checks, and even the initial consultation session with a photographer can allay apprehensions. A seasoned photographer will make making you feel relaxed a top agenda item, ensuring that your encounter is not merely positive but even enjoyable.

While there is generally a lot to unpack here, reading the Google reviews of your chosen photographer will certainly help. Consider that you tend to look at reviews for products you intend to purchase on Amazon, or other online retailers. I suggest doing the same with your service providers as well. Reading about the experiences of other clients' will be helpful in understanding what you can likely expect from your headshot session.

## Stop Procrastinating Your Professional Headshot

Procrastination is likely the biggest cause why people avoid having their headshot taken. It's easy to say, "I'll get to it later" or "I'll get it done next month," but often times months or even years go by and we never take the time.

The problem with procrastination is that it leads to lost opportunities. You may not need a headshot today, but what if tomorrow there's a possible client, employer, or networking opportunity? Having a professional headshot available means that you're always prepared to put your best face forward.

One study on job candidates found that the people who already had a professional headshot when the opening was available were 34% more likely to get an interview than people who had to get a last-minute picture taken [8].

In order to stop procrastinating, create a deadline. Don't work on a "someday" basis. Many people also find that setting an appointment weeks or months ahead of time (and paying the deposit) stays with them and gets them where they need to go.

You can be like Nike, applying their tagline of "Just Do It," or you can Just do it later. But doing it later certainly has its drawbacks. Carpe Diem!

## How to Get Better Results Than Your Previous Headshots

A bad experience in the past can dissuade you from a second chance. Maybe your earlier headshot was too formal, flattering, or simply did not reveal your personality. If you've already had a bad experience in the past, it would only be understandable if you avoided repeating it.

But every photographer is different. A headshot professional understands how to work with all kinds of personalities, shapes, and expressions to create the best outcome. If you didn't care for a headshot you had taken before, chances are it wasn't your face that was the problem, but the photographer's style, process, or that expectations and goals were not aligned.

Industry figures show that 78% of those who were dissatisfied with a previous headshot stated they were "very satisfied" or "extremely satisfied" when they switched to a headshot specialist photographer [9].

To prevent disappointment, make your expectations clear. Go through the photographer's portfolio, talk about what you are concerned about, and ask if there is a possibility of retouching. A good photographer will listen to your desires and make sure that your new headshot does you justice.

Communicating openly and frequently with your photographer will ensure that goals, expectations, and results are all aligned.

## How to Choose the Right Headshot Photographer

With all those photographers, styles, and packages to pick from, it's overwhelming to know what to do. Some people don't even get a headshot because they don't know where to start.

42% of business professionals surveyed said they avoided having a headshot because they were confused by options, and 63% took more than three hours researching photographers before deciding [10].

The easiest way to conquer decision paralysis is by constraining your choice. Rather than endlessly scrolling through photography websites, get recommendations from your colleagues, go through Google Reviews, and view sample work. Concentrate on photographers who specialize in headshots alone, not just portraiture or general photography.

Once you've narrowed down your options, call them and ask questions. A quick phone call can help you decide who is the right person for you. Deciding and scheduling a session is usually the most difficult part. Once that's taken care of, it's easy sailing.

Once again, reading Google Reviews, reviewing portfolios, and understanding workflows and processes will help ensure that your goals and expectations are aligned with your photographer.

## Why There's No "Perfect Time" for Your Headshot

Most folks wait to have their headshots made because they don't feel "ready." They might want to lose weight, have their hair fixed up, or wait until they are more at ease with the way they appear. The problem with having this mindset is that "ready" is a moving target. There will always be something you want to do instead, or will find other obligations that supersede a photo session.

Research by a professional coaching organization found that 67% of people who put off getting a headshot because they were not "ready" still had not had one done a year later [11]. Meanwhile, they missed opportunities that a professional photograph could have helped them secure.

The truth is, you're ready now. A professional photographer knows how to get the best out of you and produce a polished, professional look. And headshots can be updated later, so don't wait for some "perfect" version of yourself.

Instead of waiting forever, love where you are right now. A great headshot is about authenticity, confidence, and approachability, not perfection.

## Tips for Camera Shy Professionals Getting Headshots

Some people just don't like posing in front of a camera. They feel stiff, awkward, unsure of themselves, or they're not sure how to stand, and they avoid headshots altogether.

A professional photographer will walk you through it, however, and make the process easy and natural. Headshot sessions are not like regular shoots. They usually have minimal posing, and a strong focus on getting real, authentic expressions.

89% of people who described themselves as "camera shy" were comfortable during a session with a professional headshot photographer who was used to working with nervous clients [12].

If you suffer from camera shyness, consider scheduling a consultation with your photographer in advance. Rehearsals in a mirror or the snapping of several calm selfies also work to set you at ease. A professional photographer not only coaches and directs you, they will also reassure you and offer gentle pointers to help you be your best self.


<Image src={TsedeyAragie} alt="Richard Waine, Professional headshots by Richard Waine Photography, Headshots by Richard Waine, example of professional headshot of a black female on a white background" class="hs-infographic" />


## How Professional Headshots Influence Perception

Apprehension about how other people will perceive your headshot is a common issue. A few people avoid having their picture taken because they don't want to be judged by colleagues, customers, or social media contacts.

But a professional headshot builds your credibility, not undermines it. A strong, professional image conveys confidence, approachability, competence, and professionalism. Studies indicate that individuals with professional headshots are viewed as 58% more competent and 32% more credible than their non-professionally photographed counterparts [13].

If you're not sure, think about the opportunities that you'll miss by not having a headshot. Whether networking, job hunting, or internet marketing, a great photo sets you apart from the crowd and makes you memorable in others' minds.

Have you ever walked into a law office or the offices of another high-end professional? Have you ever taken notice of the furniture or the art on the walls? The environment creates a feeling of expertise, and influences your perception of their level of expertise. The same can be said of your headshot. Why have a high quality headshot image? Because it will affect the perception of others and create the sense that you are an authority in your field.

## Modern Headshot Styles: Beyond Formal Photography

Some folks resist the idea of a formal headshot because it feels too artificial or staged. They might think that professional photos mean stiff business portraits that are not very personable.

Headshot photography has advanced significantly. While you might think that technology has played a role in this, but the reality is that it has more to do with the photographer and their ability to direct you than the tools they use. Professional headshots now are more relaxed and natural than the rigid, formal style. The majority of photographers specialize in capturing spontaneous, warm expressions that best represent your personality. Though it may feel like the images are so spontaneous that a good headshot image is elusive, this is just another technique in our arsenal. My best guidance would be to "play the game." You'll be amazed with the results!

Professional trends suggest that relaxed, authentic headshots trounce traditional formal portraits by 47% on social media and business websites [14].

If you're concerned about looking too formal or "corporate," communicate with your photographer. They can make some changes that suit the appearance you're comfortable with, whether that is relaxed, artistic, or business-professional.

## Why You Need a Headshot Even If You're Not Active Online

Some avoid headshots because they are not present online or simply don't think they need an online professional image. They are not on LinkedIn or employing online networking, or they aren't necessarily client facing, so they don't consider a headshot essential.

Although you may not be online or client facing, others may still be searching for you. Clients, employers, or business partners typically search for images online before meeting someone in person. As a matter of fact, 85% of recruiters and potential clients report that they look for a candidate or business contact online before meeting them [15].

A headshot professional ensures that when people do come across you, they see a tidy, professional face, not some outdated, stale, or subpar photo. It's not just for Facebook. It's for your own image, business website, speaking engagement slides, and whatever professional papers require a photo.

You also need to consider that though you might not feel that you are in a client facing position, you are still a representative and custodian of your firm's brand. You are an important cog in a large wheel that is your company. Presenting yourself, and your colleagues as a unified team of capable professionals is an important element of marketing and branding. So, even if you may not feel essential in this endeavor, you absolutely are!

## When to Update Your Professional Headshot

Others think that they don't require a new headshot since they already have one from years back. An old headshot, though, can be a liability, particularly if your look has changed a lot.

Statistics indicate that 73% of individuals say they feel disconnected when they meet someone whose online image does not reflect their current appearance [16]. This disconnection can erode trust and form a bad first impression.

There are certainly some professions and professionals who use images that are more than 10 years old. Those I have spoken with delay or avoid having new headshots made because they still want to appear as their younger selves. This is where vanity can be a liability. As I mentioned earlier, when you walk into a meeting with a client who has never met you and has only seen your photos, you must avoid destroying your credibility. Your images must be representative of the person you are today. Not who you were years ago. Doing anything less risks deteriorating trust, even before it's built.

Your headshot must be representative of what you look like now. If the headshot that you currently use is more than 2-3 years old, then most likely it doesn't accurately portray you anymore. A new headshot ensures you are recognized as a person in real life, and your internet profile remains active and current.

A professional headshot is not just a picture. It's a reflection of who you are now. Having it updated guarantees you're always making the best impression you can.

## Why Professional Headshots Are Worth the Investment

To delay a headshot is harmless but can be the cause of lost opportunities. Employment searches, networking, and self-promotion are sectors in which a good headshot establishes credibility and reliability. Every single reason people avoid headshots: cost, shyness, lack of urgency, or fear are correct, yet none of them are insurmountable.

According to a 2023 career development survey, those professionals who maintain modern, high-quality headshots are 71% more likely to be considered for leadership positions and receive 38% more engagement on their professional material [17].

A professional headshot is an investment in you, and [headshots are more affordable than you think](/blog/why-professional-headshots-are-more-affordable-than-you-think). They are an affordable investment with big returns for your career, business, and personal brand. Don't wait any longer, do it now. Find a reputable headshot photographer, schedule a session, and invest in the authority of a confident, polished image that works for you.
