## Introduction

In the world of professional headshot photography, standing out means more than just having the right equipment—it's about creating genuine connections that translate into powerful imagery. Today, we're sitting down with **Jon Erlien**, a Sheboygan, Wisconsin-based photographer who specializes in headshots, branding portraits, and commercial photography with a focus on helping people "show up as their best selves."

## About Jon Erlien: From Design to Photography

### Please introduce yourself, where you are located, and the type of work you specialize in

I'm Jon Erlien—Jon with no H—based in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. I specialize in headshots, branding portraits, commercial photography, and creative strategy. I've photographed thousands of people, and I'm all about helping people show up as their best selves while creating scroll-stopping visuals that actually make people feel something.

### What led you into this creative field, and what keeps you passionate about it?

Honestly? I started with design and retouching, but the moment I picked up a camera, I realized I was meant to connect with people. That spark—the one you get when someone sees themselves the way you see them—that's the fire that keeps me going. That and the fact that I'm obsessed with light, expression, and a damn good conversation.

## The Jon Erlien Approach to Headshot Photography

### From your perspective, what makes a great headshot truly effective?

It's not the lens or the lighting (though I've got that dialed). It's the connection. If your headshot doesn't feel like you, it's just a picture. A great headshot makes people pause. It shows confidence, warmth, and approachability—all in a fraction of a second.

### As a photographer, how do you help clients feel more comfortable in front of the camera?

I disarm people with humor, honesty, and a zero-pressure vibe. I shoot tethered so clients can see the magic happening in real time. I give direction, but it's conversational, not robotic. My clients often say, "Wow, that was actually fun." That's the goal. Comfort = confidence = killer results.

## Professional Photography in the Digital Age

### What's your opinion on the importance of professional visuals in today's digital-first world?

It's everything. First impressions live online now. Your headshot, your brand video, your website visuals—they all speak before you do. People judge fast, and visuals are your handshake. So yeah, it matters. A lot.

### Have you noticed any trends in how professionals want to be portrayed today?

Absolutely. People want to look competent and human. They're moving away from stiff, corporate headshots and toward images that show approachability, individuality, and realness. It's all about intentional imperfection—well-lit authenticity.

## Client Experience and Results

### In your experience, how do different professions approach headshots differently?

CEOs want to look powerful but approachable. Creatives want to look interesting without trying too hard. Medical professionals want clean and trustworthy. Each industry has its own nuance—but regardless of title, people want to feel like they belong in their photo.

### For clients who don't feel "photogenic," what advice do you typically give?

First off, you're not broken. You're just not used to seeing yourself the way others do. Most people think they aren't photogenic because they've only seen bad photos. That changes in my studio. I guide you, light you, and hype you up. Trust the process—I got you.

### What kind of preparation and considerations do you recommend for someone getting ready for a professional shoot?

Hydrate, get rest, and pick outfits you feel great in—not just what you think you "should" wear. Avoid last-minute grooming changes, and if you're unsure about anything, send me a pic or ask. My job is to make this easy.

## Behind the Scenes: Professional Photography Insights

### What kind of lighting, composition, or direction tricks do you think most clients would be surprised to learn about?

Most people don't realize how much I'm shaping light to sculpt the face. Even subtle angles, shadows, or reflector placement can make or break a shot. Also—real talk—posing is fake. It's all guided movement and micro-expression coaching. We create natural by engineering it.

### What's a common misconception people have about what a headshot session is really like?

People think it's going to feel awkward or stiff—like school picture day 2.0\. In reality, it's fun, collaborative, and surprisingly empowering. I'm not just clicking a button—I'm working with you to extract your best self.

## Professional Advice and Industry Insights

### How do you think photographers and videographers can differentiate themselves in such a competitive industry?

By being themselves. You're not a commodity; you're a collaborator. Be consistent in your brand, your energy, your experience. People hire people they trust—and you can't fake trust. So show up fully, every time.

### If someone's rebranding themselves professionally, what role does a headshot or video play in that journey?

It's step one. Before the logo, before the website—you are the brand. A great headshot or intro video sets the tone for everything else. It says, "I'm serious about this next chapter." It builds credibility before you even open your mouth.

### What's one piece of advice you'd give someone nervous about investing in professional visuals?

You're not buying a photo—you're investing in how you show up in the world. If you've got a voice, a mission, or a goal, the way you present yourself matters. Get someone you trust, and let them help you shine. It's worth it.

{/* * * * */}

## Client Success Stories

### Do you have any stories of when a professional headshot, portrait, or video made a real difference for a client?

Too many to count. I've had clients land dream jobs, launch businesses, or message me saying, "I finally see myself the way I've always wanted to." That's the stuff that sticks. One woman said her portrait helped her "finally feel visible"—I'll never forget that.

## Jon's Final Thoughts and Wisdom

### Any final thoughts you'd like to share—whether it's advice for potential clients, tips for emerging creatives, or something you wish more people knew?

For clients: You deserve to be seen—and seen well.  
For creatives: It's not just about the work; it's about the experience you give.  
And for everyone: Be human first. That's where the magic lives.
