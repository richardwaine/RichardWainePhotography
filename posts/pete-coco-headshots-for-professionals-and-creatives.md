## About Pete Coco: From Musician to Professional Photographer

### Can you briefly introduce yourself, where you are located, and the type of work you specialize in?

My name is Pete Coco, I’m a photographer specializing in portraiture based in New York, with a studio on Long Island and in Brooklyn. I work with business professionals, actors, artists, and musicians to create authentic portraiture that helps tell their unique stories.

### What led you into this creative field, and what keeps you passionate about it?

I have always been passionate about making art. Early on, I was drawing, painting, playing music, acting… anything that had to do with creating. And, that led me ultimately to go to school for music (photography was still a passion too), and study jazz and classical music. Fast forward to today, and I have the joy and privilege of creating imagery for some of my heroes in the jazz world, so I have seen both my passions (music and photography) come together in a fulfilling way.

It’s easy to stay passionate about what I do, because it doesn’t feel like work for me. For instance, I was hired to photograph an iconic trio at Smoke Jazz Club in New York the other day. I arrived around 3:30 to survey the club and surrounding area, took portraits from 4-6pm, and then documented 2 sets of music, from 7-11pm. Not once did I feel like I was “working.” The key to being passionate about your work is working in a field you’re passionate about.

## The Pete Coco Approach to Professional Photography

### From your perspective, what makes a great headshot truly effective?

Connection. It’s all about connecting with the person in front of your camera. If you are able to connect with them, they will give back genuine expressions that tell their story. Lighting, composition, camera settings… we can argue forever about what works best. But you can’t argue with authenticity, and that is what I strive for in my images and life.

### As a photographer, how do you help clients feel more comfortable in front of the camera?

I think it’s important to meet them where they are. Most people absolutely hate getting a headshot, and many only do it because they are forced to. So, our job as photographers is to help them see their true selves, and create an image that they love. It takes patience and empathy to do this, but it’s rewarding to see someone look at their own image and love it, especially when it might be the first time in their life they have done so. I also run my portrait sessions by the Golden Rule: treat others like you want to be treated.

### How does your approach to capturing people differ between photography and videography, or between genres?

I think the genre thing is way overestimated by photographers. I use the same lighting and sets for all my clients, whether corporate, actors, musicians, etc. At the end of the day, my clients want images that are unique, stand out, and show them looking like a boss. I tweak the style for different types of clients, of course, and also have a consultation with them prior to the session, but there is a lot of overlap in style. In videography, the lines are more delineated when working with corporate clients, but it depends on the specific brand or individual you are working with.

## Professional Photography in Today's Market

### What's your opinion on the importance of professional visuals in today's digital-first world?

Well, as a photographer, of course I’m going to say it’s paramount for any brand. At this point, most people have a headshot, so the goal for me is to create images that stand out from a sea of faces. This is why I continue to explore with lighting, set design, and composition.

### Have you noticed any trends in how professionals want to be portrayed today?

Yes. People are moving away from the “LinkedIn” headshot style. My clients want images that tell their story in a deeper way, with a bit of dramatic flair.

### In your experience, how do different professions approach headshots differently?

Some professions absolutely need headshots, like actors, for instance. But beyond that, I don’t think it’s a “profession” thing, but rather a “value” thing. I work with a wide array of clients - insurance companies, finance, jazz musicians, authors, tech bros, you name it. The ones who choose to work with me see great value in what I do, regardless of their industry. For us as photographers, the key is to connect with these specific people and companies, as they are our ideal clients.

## Working with Clients: Preparation and Process

### For clients who don't feel "photogenic," what advice do you typically give?

First, I empathize with them. I’ve had people enter my studio, and the fear in their eyes is real! In that case, I don’t rush them. We chat, I offer them coffee or a bottle of water, and let them get to know me a bit to take the edge off. Then, I remind them that my process, which includes viewing the photos on a large monitor in real time, helps to make it so much easier to get great photos. A lot of times they are worried about something that’s easy to retouch as well, like a scar, or blemishes, or wrinkles. I remind them that we can fix those things while still making a photo that doesn’t look like it was created with an Instagram filter (i.e. plastic skin).

### What kind of preparation and considerations do you recommend for someone getting ready for a professional shoot?

Hair and makeup for the ladies is an absolute must, so I recommend that they always use my makeup artist. Bring more clothing than you think you need is the second most important ingredient. Often it’s the outfit my client didn’t think would look good that is their favorite. Don’t go on a bender the weekend before your headshot is also recommended (you’d be shocked how many times this happens).

### What's a common misconception people have about what a headshot session is really like?

They think they will hate it, and dread the process. However, my clients leave with smiles, and often tell me they regret putting it off since it was a fun and empowering time.

## Behind the Scenes: Professional Photography Insights

### What kind of lighting, composition, or direction tricks do you think most clients would be surprised to learn about?

They never believe you when you tell them to jam their neck forward and point their chin down... until they see the results. The “turtle neck” move is bar-none the one they always are shocked by.

### What do you wish more clients understood about the process behind professional photography?

The photographer makes all the difference, and they are not all created equal. Do some research before booking a photographer, including getting on the phone with them. Even if they create good work, they may not be the right personality fit for you, which makes or breaks the final images.

## Industry Advice and Professional Insights

### How do you think photographers can differentiate themselves in such a competitive industry?

Be yourself. Stop trying to copy everyone else and create work that is unique and stands out. Network, be a valuable member of your community, and your community will value you, and your services. Be humble, and remember that it's a privilege to get paid to photograph people. Once again, I run my business by the Golden Rule: Treat people the way you want to be treated. This is everything.

### If someone is rebranding themselves professionally, what role does a headshot play in that journey?

A crucial role. The images you show the world tell them more about you than any blurb can. Your image must represent your brand in the correct light, especially if you are rebranding. Just as we pay close attention to our attire, jewelry, the car we drive, etc, the images you put out there should represent the real you, or the “you” you are becoming.

### What's one piece of advice you'd give someone nervous about investing in professional visuals?

If you do your homework and find the right photographer, you will absolutely love the experience and the photos.

## Client Success Stories

### Do you have any stories of when a professional headshot made a real difference for a client?

I’m blessed to say that I have many such stories. I routinely hear from my acting clients that they have booked roles, or gotten call backs in large part due to the images we created together. I have had clients tear up in my studio upon seeing the photos, because it is the first time they love their own face. I work with a lot of child actors as well, and parents have told me that the experience working with me has helped their child’s self esteem and confidence.

## Pete's Final Thoughts

### Any final thoughts you'd like to share—whether it's advice for potential clients, tips for emerging creatives, or something you wish more people knew?

People want to work with good people. They don't want marketing schemes, gimmicks, and they don't want to work with someone who only cares about money. Like it or not, people expect so much more from a small business than they do from a large faceless corporation and the human element can't be underestimated. One of the best pieces of advice I was given when I started was, “Create the work you want to be paid for,” and this has been a key to my success. I also work tirelessly to become better at my craft — not just at the art of imagery, but also as an entrepreneur, and even as a person. Finally, mentorship is everything in 2025\. I owe so much to my mentors, and now I have the privilege of mentoring others in my own coaching group. It’s amazing how fast we can grow if we can connect with the right mentor.
